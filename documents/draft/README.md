# Modelling Project Draft Submission

You are expected to submit a draft of your project part-way through the course. This is essential for (1) making sure you make steady progress throughout the term; and (2) for the teaching staff to offer guidance so that the project is successful.

Depending on the term you are in, a grade may or may not be associated with your draft (check the main project assignment for this detail). However, failing to submit this draft may result in poor performance in your final grade, as you will miss out on the critical feedback needed to make your project a success.
